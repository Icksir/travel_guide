# Travel Guide

This is the second solo project from Scrimba's React JS course by Bob Ziroll.

The main purpose was to learn how to learn how to use data arrays, using the map() method and props to achieve reusable code. Also the page must be polished and stylied.

The design was inspired from [this Figma example](https://www.figma.com/file/QG4cOExkdbIbhSfWJhs2gs/Travel-Journal?node-id=2%3A2&t=Tp7i5JYJVpw1vTUe-0)

It was made with React JS and pure CSS.

Google Maps maps are not updated.
